# Job Automation Compliance & Best Practices Guide

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### 1. Data Protection & Privacy (GDPR/UK GDPR)
- **Lawful Basis**: Use "legitimate interests" for job searching, ensure clear documentation
- **Transparency**: Inform users about data processing, storage, and automated decision-making
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data for application purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Set retention periods for job and application data
- **Security**: Implement proper encryption for stored CV variants and personal data

### 2. Anti-Discrimination & Fairness
- **Human Review**: Always include human oversight in final application decisions
- **Bias Prevention**: Regular review of CV tailoring algorithms for discriminatory patterns  
- **Equal Treatment**: Ensure automation doesn't disadvantage protected characteristics
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of automated decisions for accountability

### 3. Platform Terms of Service Compliance
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits (Greenhouse/Lever have strict limits)
- **Authentic Applications**: Only submit genuine, human-reviewed applications
- **Bot Detection**: Avoid patterns that trigger anti-bot measures
- **User Consent**: Always obtain explicit consent before auto-submission

## Technical Best Practices

### 1. Rate Limiting & Respectful Usage
```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def rate_limit(calls_per_second=0.5):
    """Decorator to enforce rate limiting"""
    min_interval = 1.0 / calls_per_second
    last_called = [0.0]
    
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            elapsed = time.time() - last_called[0]
            left_to_wait = min_interval - elapsed
            if left_to_wait > 0:
                time.sleep(left_to_wait)
            ret = func(*args, **kwargs)
            last_called[0] = time.time()
            return ret
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@rate_limit(calls_per_second=0.2)  # Max 1 request per 5 seconds
def submit_application(api_call):
    return api_call()
```

### 2. Error Handling & Resilience
```python
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

def create_resilient_session():
    session = requests.Session()
    
    retry_strategy = Retry(
        total=3,
        status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
        method_whitelist=["HEAD", "GET", "POST"],
        backoff_factor=2
    )
    
    adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_strategy)
    session.mount("http://", adapter)
    session.mount("https://", adapter)
    
    return session
```

### 3. Security Measures
- Store API keys in environment variables only
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper session management in Streamlit
- Regular security audits of file uploads and data handling

## Recommended Usage Patterns

### 1. Supervised Automation
- User reviews all applications before auto-submit
- Clear confirmation dialogs for bulk operations
- Easy manual override for edge cases

### 2. Gradual Rollout
- Start with CV tailoring only (no auto-submit)
- Add export functionality for manual review
- Implement auto-submit for trusted platforms only

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Regular review of tailored applications
- A/B testing of CV variants
- Feedback loops from application outcomes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Basic job search and database setup
- Manual CV tailoring and review
- Export functionality

### Phase 2: Automation (Weeks 3-4)
- Bulk preparation features
- Enhanced tracking and status management
- Compliance framework implementation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Greenhouse/Lever API integration
- Auto-submit with confirmations
- Analytics and success tracking

## Monitoring & Compliance

### Daily Checks
- Review application submission logs
- Check for API rate limit violations
- Monitor job board responses and rejections

### Weekly Reviews
- Audit CV tailoring quality
- Review success/failure rates by platform
- Update compliance documentation

### Monthly Assessments
- Full DPIA review if processing >1000 applications
- Platform ToS compliance check
- Security vulnerability assessment

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Bulk Rejections**: May indicate bot detection or poor targeting
   - Solution: Implement cooling-off periods and human review

2. **API Key Compromise**: Could lead to abuse of services
   - Solution: Regular key rotation and usage monitoring

3. **GDPR Violations**: Automated processing without proper basis
   - Solution: Clear consent mechanisms and data retention policies

4. **Discrimination Claims**: Biased CV tailoring or job targeting
   - Solution: Regular bias audits and human oversight

### Emergency Procedures
- Immediate shutdown capability for all automation
- Data export procedures for compliance requests  
- Incident response plan for security breaches
- Legal escalation procedures for discrimination claims
