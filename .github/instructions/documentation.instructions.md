## Examples of Good Documentation

### Step-by-Step Instructions
```markdown
## Setting Up API Integration

1. **Obtain API Key**
   - Navigate to the platform's developer console
   - Generate a new API key with appropriate permissions
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Store this key securely

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   export PLATFORM_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```

3. **Test Connection**
   ```python
   from src.apply import test_connection
   success = test_connection("platform_name")
   ```
```

### Security Warning Example
```markdown
üîí **Security Note**: Never commit API keys to version control. Always use environment variables or secure configuration files that are gitignored.
```

### Compliance Example
```markdown
‚öñÔ∏è **Legal Compliance**: This feature requires explicit user consent and must respect platform rate limits. Ensure you have reviewed the compliance guidelines before implementation.
