# PR Merge Readiness Checker

This tool helps you quickly identify which pull requests in the repository are ready to be merged and which ones need attention.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# macOS: brew install gh
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install gh
# Windows: winget install GitHub.cli

# Authenticate (one-time setup)
gh auth login

# Run the checker
./scripts/check-prs.sh
```

### Option 2: Python Script with Token
```bash
# Set your GitHub token (get from https://github.com/settings/tokens)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Run the Python checker
python3 scripts/check-pr-merge-readiness.py
```

### Option 3: Simple Shell Script
```bash
# Basic version without authentication
./scripts/check-pr-readiness.sh
```

## What it Checks

The PR merge readiness checker analyzes each open pull request for:

- **Draft Status**: PRs marked as draft are not ready
- **Merge Conflicts**: PRs with merge conflicts need resolution  
- **Review Status**: PRs need approved reviews
- **CI/Check Status**: All automated checks must pass
- **Branch Protection**: Compliance with any branch protection rules

## Output Format

### ‚úÖ Ready to Merge
PRs that have:
- ‚úÖ Not marked as draft
- ‚úÖ No merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ Approved reviews
- ‚úÖ Passing CI checks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention
PRs that have blocking factors like:
- üìù Marked as draft
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Has merge conflicts
- üë• Needs review approval
- üî¥ Failing CI checks
- üîÑ Changes requested

## Report Files

The Python version saves detailed JSON reports to the `reports/` directory with:
- Complete PR analysis data
- Timestamp information
- Summary statistics
- Blocking factors for each PR

## Integration with Job-O-Matic

You can add this check to your daily workflow:

1. **Morning Check**: Run before starting development work
2. **Before Releases**: Verify which PRs can be safely merged
3. **Team Reviews**: Use reports to prioritize review efforts
4. **CI Integration**: Automate checks as part of your workflow

## Examples

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Check current repository
./scripts/check-prs.sh

# Check specific repository
python3 scripts/check-pr-merge-readiness.py owner repo-name

# With custom token
python3 scripts/check-pr-merge-readiness.py owner repo-name your-token
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Rate Limits
- **Issue**: 403 Forbidden errors
- **Solution**: Use GitHub token or GitHub CLI authentication

### Missing Dependencies

- **Solution**: Run `pip install requests` or use the shell version

### Authentication Issues
- **Issue**: Cannot access repository
- **Solution**: Run `gh auth login` or set `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Advanced Usage

### Automation
Add to your shell profile for easy access:
```bash
alias check-prs='cd /path/to/job-O-matic && ./scripts/check-prs.sh'
```

```yaml
- name: Check PR Readiness
  run: |
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    python3 scripts/check-pr-merge-readiness.py
```

### Custom Filtering
Modify the scripts to add custom criteria like:
- Minimum review count requirements
- Specific reviewer requirements
- Age-based prioritization
- Label-based filtering
